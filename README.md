## Deferred Shading
In deferred shading, the lighting step is postponed to a later step. Instead, in the first pass through, all geometry data is accumulated into texture buffers known as G-buffers. This is then later on used in more complex lighting operations. The benefit of doing this is that all the fragments that are in the G-buffers will ultimately be used in a single lighting pass (the depth-test has already been applied to these fragments). This ensures that we dont run multiple lighting passes over objects that might never make it to a pixel.

## Shaders
### Default
The default lighting is simply a product of the attenuation and the color from the texture. The attenuation is the falloff of the light, which in our case is linear.

### Blinn-Phong
Blinn-phong is the standard baseline shader. https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Blinn%E2%80%93Phong_shading_model

### Ramp-Shading
Ramp shading is a non-photorealistic shader that "bands" together colors of similar value and rounds them to the nearest band. In the demo, you can tune the number of bands that are used. I did an experiment where I included ramp shading as a deferred shader and compared it to the post-processing version. Instead of banding the colors themselves, in this shader, I banded the lambertian and specular coefficients and then applied it to the colors. As a result, we have a more smoother transition between color bands. The main performance difference is negligibleâ€“the deferred shader computes the bands on the fly within that same shader.
